A Prototype website for adding Everquest characters, their quests, and miscellaneous requests.

The  project contains most all of the elements needed for a website that uses Mysql and Apache.  
The goal is to add and modify characters as they are used in Project 1999, an Everquest emulator.  
The characters have 13 different class and race combinations, as well as restrictions of equipment 
they can use.  Statistics are updated so that changes can be made without having the huge time 
investment in the game to acquire them.  There is also a link to a ‘google like’ map system.  The 
goal is to have travel to locations as brief as 15 minutes, if possible.  There is also a system 
to add quests and goals.  I have added SQL files with all that is needed (except username and 
passwords) for creating a database for the website.   Maybe someone will find it useful and add 
or modify as they see fit.

Tech used:

PHP5
HTML 5
CSS
JQuery
Bootstrap 4
Mysql
